Projects for the SNHU Class CS-210-15457-M01

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving: The CornerGrocerProgram sorts and deals with lists for a simulated grocery store environment.

What did you do particularly well?: I was able to import the foreign .txt list into the program successfully.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?: I could enhance my code by allowing it to handle any list submitted to it, rather than only taking particularly named .txt files.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?: I found the most challenging pieces of the code to be the exception handling and initial .txt list file to functionality.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?: Skills that are transferable from this project would be exception handling proper file functionality.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? I used industry standard comments and clean code formatting to make my program maintainable, readable, and adaptable.

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?: I would start by making the questions clear in order to comprehend what the user needs are. I would then break down said needs into specifics and functions for the program. I would then begin coding each of the tasks to form the final product.

How does creating “user stories” help with this?: User stories would help with this process by helping me get a view of the program from the user's perspective. They help keep me goal oriented and help break up work into more manageable chunks.
    
How do I approach developing programs?: I usually begin by outlining the primary goal and then sketching out flow charts or diagrams before beginning. Getting small working versions running first is also crucial for testing. 

What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?: I feel like working towards getting comfortable with sprints can help me get small yet concise chunks of code out to meet employer demands. I also think that getting used to regular team meetings would also be beneficial for teamwork environments.
    
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?: Being a good team member undoubtedly entails maintaining clear communication and not being afraid to regularly share updates. Additionally, being open to incoming feedback is also vital. Finally, helping those behind or in need is paramount to being a good team member in software development especially.
