Projects for the SNHU Class CS-210-15457-M01



Summarize the project and what problem it was solving: The CornerGrocerProgram sorts and deals with lists for a simulated grocery store environment.

What did you do particularly well?: I was able to import the foreign .txt list into the program successfully.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?: I could enhance my code by allowing it to handle any list submitted to it, rather than only taking particularly named .txt files.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?: I found the most challenging pieces of the code to be the exception handling and initial .txt list file to functionality.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?: Skills that are transferable from this project would be exception handling proper file functionality.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? I used industry standard comments and clean code formatting to make my program maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
